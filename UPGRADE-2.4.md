=======================

**IMPORTANT**
-------------

Some inline underscore templates from next bundles, were moved to separate .html file for each template:
 - DataGridBundle
 - FilterBundle
 - UIBundle

MessageQueue component
----------------------
- Class `Oro\Component\MessageQueue\Job\JobStorage`
    - removed unused method `updateJobProgress`
- Class `Oro\Component\MessageQueue\Consumption\QueueConsumer`
    - changed the constructor signature: parameter `ExtensionInterface $extension = null` was replaces with `ExtensionInterface $extension`

ApiBundle
---------
- The `data_transformer` option for fields was removed from `Resources/config/oro/api.yml`. This option is required very very rarely and it is quite confusing for developers because its name is crossed with data transformers used in Symfony Forms, but the purpose of this option was very different and it was used to transform a field value from one data type to another during loading data. If you used this option for some of your API resources, please replace it with a processor for [customize_loaded_data](./src/Oro/Bundle/ApiBundle/Resources/doc/actions.md#customize_loaded_data-action) action.

---------------
- Class `Oro\Bundle\DataAuditBundle\Provider\AuditConfigProvider`
    - changed the constructor signature: parameter `ConfigProvider $configProvider` was replaces with `ConfigManager $configManager`

 Hint name and priority now passed as 2nd and 3rd constructor arguments
- `HINT_DISABLE_ORDER_BY_MODIFICATION_NULLS` was enabled by default for all data grids. To enable order by nulls behavior same to MySQL for PostgreSQL 
 next hint should be added to data grid config
```yaml
datagrids:
    grid-name:
       ...
       source:
           ...
           hints:
               - { name: HINT_DISABLE_ORDER_BY_MODIFICATION_NULLS, value: false }

    services.yml
    ```yml
