Feature: User
  In order to create users
  As a OroCRM Admin user
  I need to be able to open Create User dialog and create new user

  Scenario: Create new user
    Given I login as "admin" user with "admin" password
    And go to System/User Management/Users
    And press "Create User"
    When I fill "User" form with:
          | Username          | userName       |
          | Password          | 123123q        |
          | Re-Enter Password | 123123q        |
          | First Name        | First Name     |
          | Last Name         | Last Name      |
          | Primary Email     | email@test.com |
          | Roles             | Administrator  |
          | Status            | Active         |
    And I save and close form
    Then I should see "User saved" flash message
